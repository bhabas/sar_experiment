- CPX commands are not thread-safe. Do not run them in cluster tasks because they 
will try to access same memory in parallel and the program will hang with no output

- Sometime uploading will hang on a number like "- 6% Writing to bcAI:gap8 deck memory"
To fix this try restarting CF or a fresh firmware reload via cfclient

- Make sure the battery voltage is not less than 3.8ish V or program may fail.

- AI-Deck has no FPU (Floating Point Unit), therefore absolutely minizize any float variables or 
math to maximize performance.

- If you keep getting "Failed to flash: [Errno 16] Resource busy" errors, try unplugging radio and plugging it back in.

- Need to send task to initial cluster core before the task can be sent to other cluster cores

- If crazyswarm acts up then use 'rm ~/.ros/*.csv' to clear stuff. It might help for some reason.

- The WiFi module and the gap8 are a bit sensitive to voltage drops, so if your drone is very close to max weight and/or the battery is not the best anymore I would expect problems

- Log variables are limited to a length up to 26 as total log variable length (group + name + 1) 

- If you make changes in the crazyswarm package, make sure you compile with catkin_make inside ros_ws and not just in catkin_ws. They are seperate things and both need to be compiled seperately.


AI-Deck
=======================
- 'make all' will upload script that stays on deck and will run from start up.
- 'make run' will upload script that goes away after reboot.
